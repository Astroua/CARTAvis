The Externals is a symlink that points to a directory outside of the
source tree (i.e. it is not managed by git):

        Externals -> ../CARTAvis-externals

The idea is to put any developer-specific files into
../CARTAvis-externals directory, rather than storing them in the git
repo directly. The directory itself is organized into subdirectories:

================================================================================
ThirdParty/
================================================================================

ThirdParty contains symbolic links to various libraries that carta
needs.  On Pavol's machine, the contents look like this and you should
adjust yours to look similarly:

        qwt -> /home/pfederl/Software/qwt-6.1.2-qt-5.3.2
        qooxdoo-3.5-sdk -> /home/pfederl/Software/qooxdoo-3.5-sdk
        qooxdoo-4.0.1-sdk -> /home/pfederl/Software/qooxdoo-4.0.1-sdk
        pureweb-4.1.1-sdk -> /home/pfederl/Work/Software/PureWeb/4.1.1/SDK
        cfitsio-3360-shared -> /home/pfederl/Software/cfitsio3360shared
        wcslib-4.23-shared -> /home/pfederl/Software/wcslib-4.23-shared
        rapidjson -> /home/pfederl/Software/rapidjson
        casacore-1.5.0-shared -> /home/pfederl/Software/casacore-1.5.0-shared
