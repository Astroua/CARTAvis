The Externals is a symlink that points to a directory outside of the
source tree (i.e. it is not managed by git).

The structure of the external directory looks like this on my (Pavol) machine. You should adjust yours to look similarly:

pfederl@snail$ find ../CARTAvis-externals -printf '%p -> %l\n'
../CARTAvis-externals -> 
../CARTAvis-externals/ThirdParty -> 
../CARTAvis-externals/ThirdParty/qwt -> /home/pfederl/Software/qwt-6.1.2-qt-5.3.2
../CARTAvis-externals/ThirdParty/qooxdoo-3.5-sdk -> /home/pfederl/Software/qooxdoo-3.5-sdk
../CARTAvis-externals/ThirdParty/qooxdoo-4.0.1-sdk -> /home/pfederl/Software/qooxdoo-4.0.1-sdk
../CARTAvis-externals/ThirdParty/pureweb-4.1.1-sdk -> /home/pfederl/Work/Software/PureWeb/4.1.1/SDK
../CARTAvis-externals/ThirdParty/cfitsio-3360-shared -> /home/pfederl/Software/cfitsio3360shared
../CARTAvis-externals/ThirdParty/wcslib-4.23-shared -> /home/pfederl/Software/wcslib-4.23-shared
../CARTAvis-externals/ThirdParty/rapidjson -> /home/pfederl/Software/rapidjson
../CARTAvis-externals/ThirdParty/casacore-1.5.0-shared -> /home/pfederl/Software/casacore-1.5.0-shared
