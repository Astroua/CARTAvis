Functionality we need from vector graphics:

- easily create (stateful, hierarchical, extendible)
- rasterize in c++ (on server side)
- convertible to PDF/EPS/... others?
- serializable so that in can be transferred to client side
- rasterize in html5
- support diff
  - an object representing VG needs the ability to modify only parts of it
    and record the changes
      e.g. when user change just the color of a grid, only the color command is changed
- support interactivity on client side


Easy creation:
==============
API should allow simple things to be done easily. For example, if we want to define
- modeled after opengl (stateful)
  e.g. set line color to blue
       draw line
       draw another line

       ... both lines will be blue ...

- hierarchical/extendible
  e.g. define box
       draw line
       draw line
       draw line
       draw line
       end define
       call box
       scale 0.5
       call box
       ... will draw 2 boxes, one big, another 1/2 size
  or:  save state
       push point (4,4)
       push double (10)
       call circle
       restore state
       save state
       push point (5,5)
       push double (3)
       call circle
       restore state
       ... will draw 2 circles
           circle1: center 4,4 radius 10
           circle2: center 5,5 radius 3
