There are two scripts createlinksMac.sh and createlinks.sh that are used to create symbolic link in 
ThirdParty directory to various libraries and headers that CARTA needs.
Those links can be created manually but it is easier to do it with the script. Just edit script to point to the 
lib and include directories and run it. It will create symbolic links in the ThirdParty directory.
